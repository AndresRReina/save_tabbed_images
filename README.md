## TODO

* Allow specifying custom subdirectory of downloads folder via chrome.downloads.download "filename" option
* Select overwrite setting

* Better feedback after clicking "download" - say where the files are downloaded to (i.e. chrome.downloads.showDefaultFolder())
* Add number of current windows with images to icon

* Standardize img extensions, iterate dynamically
* Rewrite using jquery
	* Remove jquery dependency for something lighter?
* Option to only download from current window (default), or all windows?
